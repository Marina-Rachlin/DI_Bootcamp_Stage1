# Exercise 1 : Built-In Functions
# Instructions
# Python has many built-in functions.
# If you feel that you donâ€™t know how to properly implement them take a look at the python documentation online.

# Write a program which prints the results of the following python built-in functions: abs(), int(), input().
# Using the __doc__ dunder method create your own documentation which explains the execution of your code. Take a look at the doc method on google for help.

class Program:
    """
    This program demonstrates the usage of built-in Python functions: abs(), int(), and input().

    It prompts the user for input, performs certain operations using the built-in functions, and prints the results.

    Instructions:
    1. Enter a number to find its absolute value using the abs() function.
    2. Enter a floating-point number to convert it to an integer using the int() function.
    3. Enter your name to display it using the input() function.

    Examples:
    - Input: -5
      Output: The absolute value of -10 is 10

    - Input: 3.5
      Output: The integer value of 3.5 is 3

    - Input: Marina
      Output: Your name is: Marina
